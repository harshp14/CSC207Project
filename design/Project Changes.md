# Project Planning
-   Host tetris game using server to allow multiple players to play the game together using the same pieces 
-     Can use observable design pattern to dictate which pieces are chosen next by having an obseravable choose all the pieces and each client as an observer that gives       the user their next piece based on the obserervables choice

-  Save custom shapes (Not rly a QoL change but it's a change)
-  change color of board and pieces based on corrections for different forms of color blindness
## QoL Changes

-   Global leaderboard using a database with SQL queries
-   Rotate board in both direction

-   Show the next piece in the UI
